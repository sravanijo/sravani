<h2>M.Tech project description </h2>
<p font-family:sans-serif> 

In this project we take a look at WiMAX primarily based community and determine the presentation for Quality of service (QoS) 
using IEEE 802.16 innovation WiMAX technology. A appropriate classification approach in modern communication is on hand that is by using 
the usage of QoS manner that is managed via the community network operator by developing a new System methodology to QOS with FAIRNESS by
 means of in cooperating some principle concepts like UGS, in cooperating some standards like UGS,Ertps,Rtps,BE for VOIP,Video,HTTP. 
 we are overcoming the issues like limited Bandwidth and limited energy.
 This scheduler proposes some other planning scheme mirroring the defer prerequisite of rtps associations as for the distinct nrtps associations with 
 accomplish the best ideal QoS requirement, barring the immoderate aid consumption due to the fact that it

B.Tech Project description
</h2>
<p>
We have implemented a system that can be used in shopping malls to solve the rush at billing counter using RFID based trolley.
There are three main concepts developed in this project
<ol type = "1">
<li>	Inventory management system in a website and billing system too</li>
<li> 	An app that enables the view of item details of shopping in customer mobile </li>
<li> 	IOT kit and Arudino coding</li>
